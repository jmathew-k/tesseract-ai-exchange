                    In Gen AI, creators are taking back ownership and control over
                    their creativity. All collections on Tesseract are
                    creator-owned smart contracts that will stand the test of
                    time.

                    Scalable Inference Infrastructure is critical for building a seamless experience.
                    Make your model available to customers that need planet scale inferencing.

                <p>
                    Plus, we derive our GPUs overhead from customer request making it available at no cost.
